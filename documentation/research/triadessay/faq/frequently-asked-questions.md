# Frequently Asked Questions - Triadessay

## Quality and Reliability

### How do you ensure paper quality?

First, our writers all graduated from the world's top 500 universities (QS500). Before joining us, they go through strict screening to ensure excellent writing skills, exceptional learning abilities, and the authenticity of their educational backgrounds. Second, after papers or other academic tasks are completed, our review teachers will conduct audits and provide Turnitin plagiarism reports and AI reports to ensure quality and originality.

## Payment and Security

### How do I pay, and is payment secure?

You can pay through PayPal, WeChat, and Alipay. If you have concerns, you can also choose Taobao transactions, and we will click "ship" after the paper is delivered. We will not ask for your credit card or debit card information, so you don't need to worry about your card information and personal information being stolen.

**Regarding deposits**: **Triadessay accepts a 50% deposit in advance.** After the writer completes the work, we will first send you 50% of the content. After paying the remaining payment, we will send the remaining half of the content.

### What is your refund policy?

Before placing an order, please confirm your target grade with our customer service; otherwise, we uniformly default to "pass" as the target grade. If the final grade does not pass or does not reach our agreed target grade, we promise **full refund** or **tiered partial refund** (e.g., if we guarantee 90 points but you get 85 points, we will refund 50%; if you get 75 points, we refund 75%; below 70 points is a full refund). After order delivery, we will not pay the writer until the grades are released, plus our third-party transaction options, so there's no need to worry.

**Important Notes:**
1. We accept a grade release date of 2 months. If you request a refund more than 2 months after the due date, you may not receive a full refund.
2. If grades do not meet standards and require a refund, please provide detailed feedback from the school teacher and your submission page to ensure the original work was not modified later or that the work was not rated low for non-quality reasons.

## Pricing and Services

### Can you handle urgent orders?

Yes! We accept urgent orders with submission times as short as 6 hours or even shorter. For urgent orders, we pursue speed while maximizing quality control. However, the reality is that for extremely difficult tasks (including papers, programming, problem-solving, etc.), the quality of urgently completed work will not be very high. **This means that writers usually can only guarantee PASS or C- (depending on specific circumstances) for urgent tasks.** Therefore, we still recommend that everyone place orders early to ensure a good final grade.

## Revisions and Modifications

### Can papers be modified after delivery?

**Of course!** For every paper, we provide **at least 2** free revision opportunities. For reasonable modifications, our writers will responsibly complete them.

It should be noted that: Writers also have their own time, so each new modification request submitted after paper delivery may not be 100% delivered according to the time you specify, but we will do our best to meet your requirements. **For unreasonable modifications (such as: requirements not mentioned when placing the order, modifications you think are necessary but not from school teachers/professors, and may cause the paper score to decline)**, we **may** charge additional fees or **change the grade guarantee rules we agreed upon in advance**. Given that everyone's time is precious, please be sure to clearly state all requirements when placing an order to avoid unnecessary modifications and waste of manpower/time/resources.

## Academic Integrity and Safety

### How can I ensure the professor won't discover I used a writing service?

**Answer:**
1. You need to ensure that the level reflected in your work is not too different from your actual level. Of course, our writers will help confirm this.
2. You need to ensure that the author name in the file properties of your uploaded work (such as the author name in Word document file properties) is not someone else's name, which in our past experience is extremely important.
3. In specific situations, you need to have some understanding of your uploaded work. Our writers will help you understand the conception and main points of an article.
